# cat_and_mouse
An extremely basic and silly game I made for my young daughter in order to familiarize myself with PyGame

## Requirements
* Python 2 (2.7) or 3 compatible
* PyGame

## Controls
Move the cat using the arrow keys
'm' to mute or unmute sound
'q' to quit

## Settings
The settings.ini file can be edited to adjust various game attributes and aspects of gameplay. It is fairly self explanatory.

## TODO
1. ~~Display time in mm:ss instead of ms.~~
2. ~~Put a time limit on gameplay.~~
3. ~~Add a game menu with settings.~~
4. Expand gameplay (multiple levels, different objects, etc.).
5. ~~Fix \'known incorrect sRGB profile\' warning~~
6. Everything else!
