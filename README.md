# cat_and_mouse
An extremely basic and silly game (still in progress) I made for my young daughter in order to familiarize myself with PyGame

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* PyGame

## Controls
Move the cat using the arrow keys  
'm' to mute or unmute sound (not currently functional)  
'q' to quit

## Settings
The settings.ini file can be edited to adjust various game attributes and aspects of gameplay. It is fairly self explanatory.

## TODO
1. ~~Display time in mm:ss instead of ms.~~
2. Put a time limit on gameplay.
3. Add a game menu with settings.
4. Expand gameplay (multiple levels, different objects, etc.).
5. Everything else!
